Several gender gaps have shrunk over past decades in developed countries.
 However,
 a gender gap in entrepreneurship sill persists.
 In fact,
 the difference between men and female entrepreneurs have risen in recent decades.
 Fewer female entrepreneurs,
 in quantity and quality,
 can decrease aggregate output and productivity.
 The entrepreneurial gap can be caused by four labor market distortions:
 (i) a gender profit gap,
 (ii) the presence of household production,
 (iii) a capital restriction for female entrepreneurs and a (iv) wage gap.
 Using a span-and-control model,
 this thesis measures the macroeconomic effects of each distortion and identifies which ones have negative effects.
 A 20% household productivity increase leads to a 6.3% reduction of GDP,
 while a profit gap of 20% can decrease GDP in 3%.
 In contrast,
 the capital and wage gaps have little and no impact on macroeconomic variables in the general equilibrium.
 Overall,
 these findings suggest that childcare policies and reducing a gender profit gap can increase aggregate output and productivity.

\begin_layout Standard
Several gender gaps have shrunk in the last decades.
 In the United States,
 the difference between female and male labor force participation rates has decreased from 52% in 1950 to 14% in 2005.
 For OECD countries,
 International Labor Organization (ILO) data show that this difference has changed from 25.8% in 1990 to 17.3% in 2018.
 The gender wage gap followed a similar trend.
 According to the OECD,
 the difference between the median earnings of men and women relative to median earnings of men has decreased from 19.6% in 1995 to 13.4% in 2017.
 In terms of education,
 the differences between secondary and tertiary education attainment between male and females has significantly reduced.
 The gender gap in tertiary education enrollment flipped from 2.9% in 1990 to -2.2% in 2000 for the United States (Parro,
 2020) and flipped from 0.7% in 2000 to -6.5% in 2018 for OECD.
 In addition,
 women have increased their political participation.
 In the European Union,
 women represented 20.5% of the parliament seats in 2002 and this increased to 31.7% in 2019.
